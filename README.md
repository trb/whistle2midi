#Whistle to Midi

This is an attempt at a piece of software that can turn recordings of whistling into a midi file.

Right now, it is mostly miss with a few hits included. Every now and then it will reconstruct the correct notes in the generated midi file, but it needs a lot more tuning until it's actually usuable.

##Why?

I wanted to work with the fast fourier transformation, and being able to whistle a beat or melody instead of having to create one in a note setting application seemed like a good application.
